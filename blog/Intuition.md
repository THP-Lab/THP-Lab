# Introduction

## About us

Weâ€™re a team of 5 developers in training from The Hacking Project, a Bootcamp school in France. The team is composed of:

- **Sacha Godel**
- **Thibault Lenormand**
- **Alexandre Tedesco**
- **Thomas Bobichon**

This project is important to us, as it is the final project of our training which will validate our diploma!

With us thereâ€™s **Jeremie**, aka Zet, whoâ€™s advising us, as he is really familiar with Web3 and cryptocurrencies.

We contacted the team working on Intuition, who are working on a platform where you can create information on the RDF model, which you can find [here](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).

On Intuition, you create an **Atom** in which you can stock any piece of information. For example, I can create an identity for myself, and use it to make claims about me.

When you link Atoms together, by using one as the subject, a predicate, and an object, you get a **Triple**. An easy example to show this would be:  
_(Elon Musk) â€“ (is CEO of) â€“ (Tesla)_.

With this, you can create claims and build a real network of information.

Intuition is using the Base Blockchain, which guarantees that every piece of information is immutable and accessible to everyone thanks to the history of transactions.

# Objectives

Weâ€™ve got two objectives in this project:

1. **Make Triplets related to each other**  
   Example:  
   _(Sacha â€“ has completed â€“ (Fullstack (spring-2024 â€“ session) (of â€“ THP â€“ Bootcamp)))_  
   Several Triplets are put into one, linking Sacha to all of these statements, allowing for a deeper level of connections and information, starting from one Atom.

2. **See it happen on a graph**  
   When youâ€™ve got a list of Atoms, you can apply filters and see your main subject in the middle with its relations around it. This allows quick access to a huge list of information starting from a precise point.

# Delivery

Weâ€™re making this project **Open Source**, so anyone is free to help and/or contribute to this project.

Once done, we hope anyone who wants to create their own data will be able to use it.

One feature weâ€™d like to implement is for our school: a way to deliver attestations to students to validate skills or abilities on demand. These attestations can be validated by other students and collaborators, giving them more credibility.

# Roadmap

## Steps to achieve our objectives

### Step 1: Experiments and improvements of existing tools to concatenate Triples

- Use a mock list of students managed by a Rails API.
- Push this data to a decentralized graph app to start testing Triplets.

### Step 2: Mass creation of Atoms

- Convert the mock data into a CSV file.
- Use Intuitionâ€™s Data Populator to massively create Atoms of our students.
- Start using the Smart Contract on the Sepolia Blockchain.
- Explore the possibility of creating Triplets instead of just Atoms with the Data Populator.

### Step 3: Switch to our Smart Contract

- Replace the Sepolia Smart Contract with ours.
- Create the subgraph and make it work, allowing data to be shown in the DApp.

### Step 4: Integrate real data from THP students

- Implement actual THP student data into Intuition.
- Create an assistant for recommendations, powered by AI.

# Components

## Mock Rails API

This component will be the basis of our tests at the beginning.

### Features:

- **Database Seeds**: Bootstrap data related to a school, its students, and the relations between them.
- **API for Graphs**: Provide an API to show a graph and visualize the data. The return data will mimic Intuitionâ€™s return.
- **CSV Export**: Produce CSV files for use with Intuitionâ€™s Data Populator.
- **Console for Triplets**: Allow direct creation of new Triples for faster testing.

## Data Populator

We aim to improve the Data Populator by adding the ability to create Triplets, similar to how Atoms are currently created in large numbers.

---

## Visualization Graph (React)

The graph helps visualize Intuition data. We plan to connect it to either our Rails API or Intuitionâ€™s SubGraph.

### Goals:

- Explore different visualization modes:
  - 2D view
  - 3D view
  - List view
- Experiment by changing the main node to better understand complex relationships.

---

## Assistant

### Users:

#### 1. User requesting a recommendation

- Fill in a text field with as much context as possible.
- The backend will use AI to generate the best way to organize Triplets for a meaningful recommendation.

#### 2. User validating a recommendation

- Validate another userâ€™s request, adding credibility to the recommendation.

The process is simple: once the first user makes the request, the backend generates a recommendation with AI. Other users can validate it to increase its credibility.

# Conclusion

This project is an opportunity to explore Web3 and blockchain-related technologies.

We aim to enable students and professionals to create rich, reliable data networks.
